# ðŸ›’ Spring E-Commerce Microservices Platform

A scalable and modular **e-commerce platform** built using **Spring Boot** and a **microservices architecture**. It demonstrates robust service integration with API Gateway, Kafka for async messaging, MongoDB for flexible schema support, and Helm/Kubernetes for cloud-native deployment.

## ðŸ§© Microservices Overview

| Service          | Description                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Config Service**  | Centralized external configuration using Spring Cloud Config |
| **Discovery Service** | Eureka service registry for microservice discovery |
| **Gateway Service**   | API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway for routing and security |
| **Product Service**   | Manages product listings and categories |
| **Order Service**     | Handles customer orders and workflows |
| **Inventory Service** | Tracks and updates stock in real-time |
| **Payment Service**   | Processes secure payments |
| **Notification Service** (optional) | Sends email/SMS notifications |

## ðŸš€ Technology Stack

- **Spring Boot 3+** â€“ Rapid development framework for building microservices with minimal configuration.
- **Spring Cloud** - â€“ Toolkit for building robust cloud-native distributed systems (Eureka, Config Server, Gateway, etc.).
- **Event-Driven Microservices** â€“ Asynchronous communication using Kafka/RabbitMQ for loosely coupled services.
- **API-driven development approach**
- **REST architectural style (e.g., RESTful APIs)**
- **Caching** -Local caching (Caffeine/EhCache) and distributed caching (Redis) for performance optimization.
- **Listen to yourself design pattern**
