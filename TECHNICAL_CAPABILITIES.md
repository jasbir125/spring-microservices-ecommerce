# Technical Capabilities

This project demonstrates a full spectrum of technical skills across architecture, development, deployment, and monitoring in a modern distributed systems environment.

## **1. Architectural Design & Best Practices**
- Microservices architecture with service autonomy and clear boundaries
- API Gateway pattern for unified entry point
- Service Discovery via Eureka
- Config Server for centralized configuration
- Circuit Breaker & Resilience patterns (Resilience4j)
- Event-driven communication using Kafka
- Polyglot persistence with SQL & NoSQL databases
- Design patterns: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, Observer, Proxy, etc.

## **2. Development Practices**
- Java Spring Boot for backend microservices
- Node.js Lambda for serverless functions
- REST API design with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- DTO mapping with MapStruct
- Lombok for boilerplate reduction
- Validation via custom annotations (`@ValidateCustomHeaders`)
- Chained setter methods with Lombok `@Accessors(chain = true)`
- Unit & Integration testing (JUnit, Mockito, Spring Boot Test)
- WebClient with retry/fallback mechanisms
- Feign Client for inter-service calls
- MongoDB Change Streams for real-time updates

## **3. Infrastructure & Deployment**
- Docker & Docker Compose for local orchestration
- Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- AWS Services: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS, CloudWatch, LocalStack for local AWS simulation
- Kafka & Zookeeper setup in containers
- CI/CD ready structure

## **4. Security & Authentication**
- OAuth2.0 integration (GitHub, custom providers)
- JWT authentication with expiry in payload
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Custom header validations

## **5. Monitoring & Logging**
- ELK stack integration (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Health check endpoints for all services
- Centralized logging strategy
- Exception handling & fallback strategies

## **6. Scalability & Performance**
- Horizontal scalability via container orchestration
- Asynchronous processing with Kafka & SQS
- Non-blocking I/O with Spring WebFlux (where applicable)
- Caching strategies for performance optimization

**This repository is a showcase of production-grade architecture patterns and implementations that can be directly applied in enterprise systems.**
